        How to Train Your Dragon is a captivating tale set in the Viking village
        of Berk, where
        <span class="strike-text">dragons are considered fierce enemies. </span>
        The story follows Hiccup, a clever but clumsy young Viking, who dreams
        of earning his place among his tribe by slaying a dragon. However, when
        Hiccup encounters and befriends a wounded Night Fury dragon named
        Toothless, he discovers that dragons are not the monsters they seem.
        Through their bond, Hiccup learns about trust, courage, and breaking
        long-standing traditions. Together, they challenge the misconceptions of
        their world and prove that friendship can conquer fear.
