        How to Train Your Dragon is a captivating tale set in the Viking village
        of Berk, where <span class="strike-text">dragons are considered fierce enemies. </span> The story follows
        Hiccup, a clever but clumsy young Viking, who dreams of earning his
        place among his tribe by slaying a dragon. However, when Hiccup
        encounters and befriends a wounded Night Fury dragon named Toothless, he
        discovers that dragons are not the monsters they seem. Through their
        bond, Hiccup learns about trust, courage, and breaking long-standing
        traditions. Together, they challenge the misconceptions of their world
        and prove that friendship can conquer fear.
